# **FP2 \- Evaluation of the Final project**

## Project Description

My motivation is to provide an interactive way to test out different pathways to win the electoral college.

## High-Fi Prototypes

### _Prototype 1_

![Prototype 1](images/prototype_1.png)

The users didn't like the yellow and was confused if the circles represent the total votes or number of votes needed.

### _Prototype 2_

![Prototype 2](images/prototype_2.png)
The users also liked the dots as opposed to the one circle, but they had conflicting views on this.
…

### _Prototype 3_

![Prototype 3](images/prototype1_3.png)
The users liked the state outlines, how the states were in the middle, and how the states were purple.

…

## Usability Test

Discuss the user feedback you got during the evaluation / usability test (\~300 words). Indicate which feedback you implemented, inspired new directions, or otherwise influenced your final design.

From these three visual directions I got a lot of good feedback on what users preferred as well as certain preferences that went beyond my current setup. I got feedback on little things, like increaseing my font size for increased readability. One thing I thought was interesting was that the size of the candidate area is more likely to be associated with how many votes they currently HAVE, not how many they need, so I decided to switch that around to be more in line with what users expect. People liked both the larger circle and the smaller dots and were split. People also liked how the states had a real outline of the state itself rather than a more abstract orb. They also felt too realistic and if it appeared more "cartoonish" that could be more approachable.

## Updated Designs

![updated design](images/prototype1.png)
Show screenshots of your updated design based on the user feedback (\<100 words, \~2 images).

## Feedback Summary

From our lab session, I got a lot of good feedback on how to represent and extend my idea itself.One person gave me an idea to combine both the dots and circle to signify how may current votes they have. Instead of making assumptions on what state is for sure blue or red and not a swing state, I could present all the states on a gradient of blue and red and the user can drag the state to be in a different category if they choose. I also got an idea that by using the scale of the states I could more explicitly explain how the electoral college works and have this serve more educational purpose. This would also increase the longevity beyond this specific election and point in time, which was one of my initital concerns about the project.
I think this will change the visauls of my design, focusing more on all the states and filling up the entire screen instead of soley focusing on swing states. I will also incorporate more context and educational text within the design.

## Milestones

Outline weekly milestones to plan your expected implementation progress until the end of the semester (\~300 words).
To ensure I can implement my idea in the alloted time, I need to break it down into a series of steps. I need to ensure I can access the libraries I want to use within my code, especially for interactions for my drag and drop functionality and any movement from the states. I then need to code the basic logic of vote counting: subtracting from votes needed and adding to total votes for candidate. Once a candidate reaches 270 the threshold is reached and the interaction is over.
Coding the basic UI, like HTML and CSS also will take time. Then I need to prepare the data for each state like name, amount of votes, and likelyhood to be a blue, purple, or red state. Then I need to work on the functionality of dragging states and dragging them to certain area (can do based on coordinates) to trigger the logic of vote counting. It would be nice to have a week dedicated for bug fixes and final touches to ensure I have a polished and fully functioning result. This also gives me wiggle room if one aspect of the project takes longer than expected. I then need to create a writeup and gather documentation for presenting this idea.

## Generative AI Use Plan

I think GenAI would be good for getting a sense of what is going on when debugging. I think also if I don't know how to implement something I could ask it to give a broad step by step approach that gives me a basic idea of what to look into further based on what I do not understand.

### _Tool Use_

What would you use? Edit the list given your plan. For each tool, explain briefly on what do you expect Generative AI to help you with and what might it not be able to help you with.

- ChatGPT
  - I will use it for giving me a broad idea of what steps I need to take and which areas I need to look into further because it can help me not neccesarily based on super specific information, but more general information.
  - I will use it for debugging purposes to see if it spots simple fixes when I get stuck because it can do that without the context of my entire code base.
  - I will not use it for entire blocks of generated code because it doesn't have the specific context of my intentions and conventions and it might not compile correctly, making me more confused.

### _Responsible Use_

I'll use GenAI responsibly by following the guidelines I set out for myself and by not treating it as an expert when there is a lot of context for any given coding project. I'll refer to others who might know best practices that GenAI doesn't have complete access to.

# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### _Idea 1_

![NYT Worldview](assets/sketch1.png)

Basic Idea: The intention of this project is to make knowledge of world events that have a long history more accessible to younger generations so they can better understand their current context and when history is cyclical.

Information: NYT articles, year they are published, who they are written by, and the location that is written about.

Plan for Interactivity: Users can use a linear slider with tick marks to change the year of the articles that appear on the map and can click the article to read it. I also would like the user to be able to zoom in and out with the trackpad and be able to drag the globe around.

Plan for Accessibility: The articles could be accessible on the map for screenreaders via the arrow keys for those with impaired vision. Articles could also be accessed through a table of contents. Moving around the map, users could also zoom in and out of the map by double tapping a spot on the map and then dragging down to zoom in or dragging up to zoom out for those with limited hand mobility. I need to ensure type sizes are large enough (perhaps could increase size in accessibility mode) and the map colors are accessible.

### _Idea 2_

![270 to Win](assets/sketch2.png)

Basic Idea: The intention of this project is to showcase my knowledge of coding game logic and animation. 270 to win is a tool that helps you visualize different paths for presidential canidates to win the electoral college.

Information: The canidates running, how many electoral votes they need to reach 270, which states are swing states, and states' number of electoral votes.

Plan for Interactivity: Users can drag around representations of the swing states and drag them over to a canidate. It will fill up a container for that canidate and once 270 is reached, will show that canidate as the winner.

Plan for Accessibility: The text can be accessible via screen reader and users could select a swing state via keyboard. However, I think more needs to be done to make it accessible. Maybe once you select a swing state, a screen reader could present the canidate options. Once you hit enter, the votes go to that canidate. Sound could be incorporated as well.
…

### _Idea 3_

![What does my voice look like?](assets/sketch3.png)

Basic Idea: The intention of this project is to try something really experiemental by visualizing the human voice in terms of color.

Information: The audio recorded would include different frequencies.

Plan for Interactivity: Users can click start and record their voice. Once they click stop, the program generates an art piece.

Plan for Accessibility: It could be accessible via screenreader for those who are visually impaired. I would have to generate alt text for each piece to describe what it looks like. The voice can also be extended to other ways human make noises, whether that be through the vocal cords or hands etc.

…

## Feedback Summary

Idea 1:
I recieved a lot of feedback on how to make this idea more within scope for this project. One idea was to chose a limited amount of topics and subtopics so they can be eaily organized. Some people also had ideas on how I could present the topic in a smaller scope by using the timeline function for only one topic or region at a time (the evolutionary history of humans would be interesting for this). People recommended that I look at how the NYT API is structured and build my application to easily follow that instead of trying to use and vet many publication APIs into my project.
I also got some advice on how to best present it functionally. I should make sure that when the user zooms out it scales (shows less articles) so that it is not overwhelming. When I expressed worry about articles being offensive as a product of their time someone suggested that I could present a disclaimer so users can think more critically.

Idea 2:
I recieved less feedback for this idea, but some people thought that I could add more information to encourage action (like where to find your polling place etc.). Multiple people also suggested that I could make the "swing states" the actual shapes of those states. I think the visual direction could be interesting to play around with.

Idea 3:
People validated that this could be done somewhat easily with p5.js, which was great to hear since feasibility was one of my concerns. People also suggested that instead of random colors, I could use the rainbow spectrum. I got some good feedback that surrounded the idea that art doesn’t have to be useful because you never know what it will turn into.

## Feedback Digestion

Digest the feedback you got in the lab (\~300 words). Indicate which critique you will act on in your next design and why you chose to incorporate/dismiss pieces of critique.

Idea 1:
I like limiting this project to the NYT API as it will make it easier to fit within the scope and it might be something I can display on a portfolio. I think I will definitley need to understand how much information is in the archive to decide how to break down topics. I will take the advice on the functionality for zooming out and scaling it to show less articles as well as inlcuding the disclaimer. I love the idea of mapping out a timeline of human history but also I'm more interested in event histories that are more related to current events.

Idea 2:
I think the developer side of me thinks that the 270 to win game would be the most satisfying. I think it would be a really nice touch to add in information at the bottom of the page directing you to find out if you are registered to vote and to find your polling station, but I didn't like the idea of putting a bunch of other information about predictions and pathways in the spirit of keeping things clean and within scope. I honestly don't really like the idea of making the states less abstract because it feels a bit cheesy, but it's something I could try.

Idea 3:
I still think in my gut that this idea is not actually easy to implement. I would hate for the visual design to suffer for the sake of getting things to work and I'm not sure if I would learn as much by applying, but moreso learn by researching into this niche thing. I would definitely map out the frequencies to the color spectrum, although this would require some math I believe.
